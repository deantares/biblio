  abstract = {Software development projects can be fun, productive, and even
             daring. Yet they can consistently deliver value to a business and
             remain under control. Extreme Programming (XP) was conceived and
             developed to address the specific needs of software development
             conducted by small teams in the face of vague and changing
             requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges many
             conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that the
             cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises
             dramatically over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects
             have to work to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the
             savings once they have been earned. You may love XP or you may
             hate it, but \textit{Extreme Programming Explained} will force
             you to take a fresh look at how you develop software.},
