  abstract =     {The new emerging Distributed Shared Memory
                  architecture promises to be more scalable than
                  Symmetric Multiprocessor architecture, and leads to
                  a regain of interest for parallel shared-memory
                  programming paradigms. This paper compares two such
                  important paradigms: classical multi-threading and
                  multi-threading based on compiler directives (with
                  OpenMP). Several implementations of regular and
                  irregular algorithms, taken from articifial
                  intelligence field, were made on an SGI-Origin2000
                  (a DSM architecture) and compared both in terms of
                  development time and of execution time. Finally, we
                  identify the most appropriate paradigm for each kind
                  of algorithm.}
